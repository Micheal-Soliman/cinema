Dear Nexus Analytica Team,

I am submitting my solution for the Frontend Position coding exercise - a React-based movie search application using the OMDb API.

Project Features:
- Movie search with debounced input
- Detailed movie information modal
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS
- TypeScript for type safety
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimizations

The project is built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS, following modern React best practices.

Setup Instructions:
1. npm install
2. Create .env.local with NEXT_PUBLIC_OMDB_API_KEY=your_key
3. npm run dev

I look forward to presenting this solution during the technical interview.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Files to Include in Submission

When sending the project, include:
- All source code files
- package.json and package-lock.json
- README.md with setup instructions
- API_SETUP.md with API key instructions
- This SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md

## Pre-Interview Checklist

Before the interview, ensure:
- [ ] Project runs without errors
- [ ] API key is working (test with a search)
- [ ] All features are functional
- [ ] You understand the code structure
- [ ] You can explain design decisions

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Next.js App Router**: Modern React framework with excellent developer experience
2. **TypeScript**: Full type safety and better code maintainability
3. **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
4. **Custom Hooks**: useDebounce for search optimization
5. **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components

## Demo Flow for Interview

1. Show the search functionality with debouncing
2. Demonstrate responsive design on different screen sizes
3. Click on a movie to show the details modal
4. Show error handling (try searching with no API key)
5. Explain the code structure and key components
6. Discuss performance optimizations implemented

Good luck with your interview!
